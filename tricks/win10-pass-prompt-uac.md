# Require Admin Password/PIN on UAC prompt

This is a good way to protect your PC from running admin tasks unless you enter your password/PIN. This is mostly useful if you share your PC, want to avoid USB Rubber Ducky and the likes from doing damage, or are generally paranoid.

For an automated edit, run _pass-prompt-uac.reg_.
Remember to always read scripts before executing them. ðŸ˜Š

Manual edit:

1. Open the Registry Editor
   Easiest way is _Win + R_ then type _regedit_ and hit _Enter_
2. Go to _Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System_
3. Change _ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin_ from a value of 5 to a value of 1
